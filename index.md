## Overview

## Description of Host Institution
Data Science @ Uni Vienna is a new research platform at the University of Vienna that presents a hub on all activities in data science at the University of Vienna. Natural language processing is inherently interdisciplinary, firstlybecause it lies at the intersection of linguistics and machinelearning, and secondly because the processing of text providesconnections to many scientific fields, such as digital humanities(through analysis of historic documents), social sciences andeconomics (through analysis of social media or financial reports), ormedical sciences (through analysis of biomedical publications orelectronic medical records). Data Science @ Uni Vienna would providethe ideal environment for the applicant to contribute to variousresearch disciplines, and to profit from the expertise in machinelearning and data mining of the research platform. We also plan to intensively collaborate with the new professorship for Digital Philology at the University of Vienna for which the appointment procedure is currently ongoing.
