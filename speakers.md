<strong> Natural Language Understanding with Incidental Supervision </strong><br>
<i>Bio:</i> Dan Roth is the Eduardo D. Glandt Distinguished Professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, and a Fellow of the AAAS, the ACM, AAAI, and the ACL. In 2017 Roth was awarded the John McCarthy Award, the highest award the AI community gives to mid-career AI researchers. Roth was recognized “for major conceptual and theoretical advances in the modeling of natural language understanding, machine learning, and reasoning.” Roth has published broadly in machine learning, natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, and learning theory. Until February 2017 Roth was the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR). His recent work has emphasized, among other topics, the notion of incidental supervision as a way to get around the inherent difficulty in supervising complex problems in various areas in natural language understanding.

<strong>Snorkel: Programmatically Labeling Training Data</strong><br>
<i>Bio:</i> Paroma Varma is a co-founder of Snorkel AI, an AI start-up based on the influential Snorkel project. Snorkel AI provides a data-first platform for building, managing, and monitoring end-to-end AI applications. Paroma received her Ph.D. from Stanford University and she was supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. Her research interests revolve around weak supervision, or using high-level knowledge in the form of noisy labeling sources to efficiently label massive datasets required to train machine learning models. In this context, she is also interested in using developer exhaust, byproducts of the data analytics pipeline, to simplify complex statistical and search-based problems.
